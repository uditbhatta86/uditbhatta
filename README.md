# About me
#### I am a graduate student in Geospatial Technology based in the United States, with more than ten years of professional experience in education, environmental conservation, and community-based programs in Nepal. I am currently developing my technical and analytical skills to work at the intersection of geospatial science, Earth observation, and geospatial intelligence (GEOINT).

#### My interests lie in understanding how spatial data, remote sensing, and GIS can support better decision-making for environmental management, risk analysis, and sustainable development. Disaster resilience is one of the key application areas for this work, alongside broader challenges related to infrastructure, energy systems, and environmental change.

# Current focus

### GIS and remote sensing
### Google Earth Engine
### Python for geospatial workflows and spatial analysis
### ArcGIS Pro and QGIS
### Git and GitHub for reproducible and collaborative research

# Areas of interest

### Geospatial intelligence and spatial data analysis
### Environmental change and climate adaptation
### Disaster risk and resilience
### Land use, water, and ecosystem monitoring
### Applied geospatial research for decision support

# What this GitHub represents

This is a record of my learning process. I use this space to document coursework, practice projects, technical experiments, and geospatial workflows as I continue to grow as a geospatial analyst.

# Long-term direction

I am interested in developing geospatial solutions that are guided by client and stakeholder needs, translating complex spatial data into actionable insights, and applying those insights to strengthen communities, infrastructure systems, energy resilience, and environmental conservation.

# Collaboration

I am open to collaborating on projects related to geospatial analysis, Earth observation, environmental monitoring, and risk assessment.
